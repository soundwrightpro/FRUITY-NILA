##### Installation

Native Instruments Host Integration service must be installed and running. It is automatically the case
if you installed Komplete Kontrol on your machine.

1. Download **the zip** and unzip. Place the 'Native Instruments' to the FL Studio User data 
folder under the following location:

   ```... Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware\```  

2. In FL Studio 20.7.1 or higher under the MIDI tab in settings set Komplete Kontrol M DAW as Komplete Kontrol DAW in Input, for your M32 or A-Series. Only for MAC OS Set Port to 1. Above in Output select "Send Master Sync" once again set Port to 1. See GIF for clarification.
