# FL NI KK v8.5.1 for FL Studio 20.8.2 and higher

#### Written by Duwayne Wright

Providing support for the Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32 and the A-Series with FL STUDIO. Uses the NI Host Integration protocol instead of the limited MIDI Mode NI provides, so the controller acts like as if it was connected to Ableton or Logic Pro X. The Komplete Kontrol App and/or Plugin does not have to be running for this script to function. This script doesn't interfere with the operation of the Komplete Kontrol Plugin. 

**You must have FL Studio 20.9 or higher, Komplete Kontrol v2.3.0, and Firmware 0.3.9 or higher**. 

## Main features

- Takes advantage of the DAW integration mode
- Playback control right from the device

My thanks to [Hobyst](https://github.com/hobyst) for their documentation, programs, and coding help and my thanks to the developers over at Image-Line for making MIDI scripting available & answering all of my questions.

**DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SCRIPT TAKES PLACE ON A M32**



Download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/hobyst/flmidi-kompletekontrol/releases/latest "latest stable release").



##### Installation

Native Instruments Host Integration service must be installed and running. It is automatically the case
if you installed Komplete Kontrol on your machine.

1. Download **the zip** and unzip. Place the 'Native Instruments' to the FL Studio User data 
folder under the following location:

   ```... Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware\```  

2. In FL Studio 20.7.1 or higher under the MIDI tab in settings set Komplete Kontrol M DAW as Komplete Kontrol DAW in Input, for your M32 or A-Series. Set Port to 1. Above in Output select "Send Master Sync" once again set Port to 1. See image for clarification.
