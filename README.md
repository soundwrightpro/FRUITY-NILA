# FRUITY NILA for FL Studio
(Fruity Native Instruments Lanuage Agent)


#### Written by Duwayne Wright

**FRUITY NILA** provides support for the Native Instruments [Komplete Kontrol M3](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-m32/) and the [A-Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-a25-a49-a61) with [FL STUDIO](https://www.image-line.com/). By using the NI Host Integration protocol instead of the limited MIDI Mode NI provides, the controller acts like as if it was connected to Ableton or Logic Pro X. The Komplete Kontrol App and/or Plugin does not have to be running for this script to function. FRUITY NILA doesn't interfere with the operation of the Komplete Kontrol Plugin. 

**You must have Komplete Kontrol v2.3.0 or higher, and Firmware 0.3.9 or higher**.
