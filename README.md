# FRUITY NILA 
<sup>(Fruity Native Instruments Lanuage Agent - MIDI script for FL Studio)</sup>

![DEVICE SCREEN](/images/NILA1.jpg)

#### Written by Duwayne

**FRUITY NILA** provides support for the Native Instruments [Komplete Kontrol M3](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-m32/) and the [A-Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-a25-a49-a61) with [FL STUDIO](https://www.image-line.com/). By using the Native Instruments Host Integration protocol instead of the limited MIDI mode Native Instruments provides, the controller acts like as if it was connected to Ableton or Logic Pro X. The Komplete Kontrol App and/or Plugin does not have to be running for this script to function. FRUITY NILA doesn't interfere with the operation of the Komplete Kontrol Plugin. 

**You must have Komplete Kontrol v2.3.0 or higher, and Firmware 0.3.9 or higher**.
