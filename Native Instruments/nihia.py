    The third (and last) argument depends on what kind of information you are going to send:

     - value (integer): Can be 0 (no) or 1 (yes). Used for two-state properties like to tell if the track is solo-ed or not (except `"EXIST"`).

     - info: Used for track name, track pan, track volume and the Komplete Kontrol instance ID.

    also use the `mixer.getTrackPeaks` function directly to fill the argument, but remember you have to specify the left and the right channel separately. You have to
